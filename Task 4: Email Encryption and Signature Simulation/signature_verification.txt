When Alice signs the message with her private key, she creates a special code called a digital signature that proves the message came from her. When Bob receives the message, he uses Alice’s public key to check the signature. If the signature matches the message, it proves that Alice really sent it and that no one changed it along the way. Basically, because only Alice has her private key, a valid signature means she’s the real sender, and the message hasn’t been tampered with. This helps Bob trust that the message is genuinely from Alice and is exactly what she sent.
