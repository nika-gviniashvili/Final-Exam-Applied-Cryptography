In this project, we use a combination of two types of encryption to send messages securely. First, Bob creates a pair of keys: a public key that he shares with others and a private key that he keeps secret. Alice writes her secret message and then generates a random AES key and IV, because AES is very fast and good for encrypting large data. She encrypts her message with AES, making it unreadable to anyone without the key. Then, she encrypts the AES key itself using Bob’s public RSA key, so only Bob can unlock it with his private RSA key. Alice sends both the encrypted message and the encrypted AES key to Bob, who uses his private RSA key to decrypt the AES key. With this key, Bob decrypts the message using AES, restoring the original text. Hashes are used before and after to make sure the message hasn't been tampered with. Comparing AES and RSA, AES is much faster and is used for encrypting big data, while RSA is slower but very secure, mainly used for safely sending small pieces of information like keys or for digital signatures. Using both together — called hybrid encryption — combines the speed of AES with the security of RSA, making communication both fast and safe.
